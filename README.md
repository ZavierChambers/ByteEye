# üîê EndorSec - Endpoint Detection & Response (Self-Hosted) - Short for ‚ÄúEndpoint + Orchestrated Security‚Äù

EndorSec is a fully self-hosted, open-source Endpoint Detection and Response system designed for local environments, homelabs, or small-scale enterprise use. It provides active threat detection, secure log collection, and real-time visibility across your endpoints without sending data to any third-party cloud providers.

## üß† Project Overview

This project demonstrates the importance of **endpoint security monitoring** and **real-time threat response**. Built with **Python and C++**, it includes:

- üõ∞Ô∏è **Agent** that monitors endpoint activity
- üõ†Ô∏è **Self-hosted Server** for secure data collection and orchestration
- üåê **Web Interface** for real-time visibility and threat hunting
- üîê **Encryption-first communication**, ensuring all data in transit is safe

---

## üéØ Goals

1. **Design an encrypted agent** to safely collect system activity and send alerts.
2. **Build a server** that handles multiple simultaneous endpoint connections.
3. **Deploy a Web UI** for live interaction and threat event inspection.
4. **Track development progress** using a milestone-driven plan.
